# FitBit_Data_Analysis
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project


This Project uses R and SQL to explore the Fitness Tracker Data available at Kaggle.
The fitbit data is publicly available on Kaggle and can be downloaded from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit 

Set up your MySQL connection within the R setup to run SQL Queries. 
Details can be found on the official Posit website https://solutions.posit.co/connections/db/
Once you have run your analysis make sure you close the sql connection.

NOTE: Code Chunks for setting up the sql connection and closing it have been removed from the RMD file uploaded here. 
You would need to add these seperately based on your configurations. Sufficient guidance is available
on the posit website if you haven't done this before

In case you plan to share your work externally, remove details related to setting up and closing your
sql connection.

This RMD file creates a duplicate file for external sharing. Once the duplicate is created, you can edit it to
remove any credentials and then share the file as needed
