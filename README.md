# FitBit_Data_Analysis

This project was created as part of the final Google Data Analytics Capstone Project.

Please refer to the .pdf file to view the final report and the .Rmd file to view the code.

* This Project uses R and SQL to explore the Fitness Tracker Data available at Kaggle.
* The fitbit data is publicly available on Kaggle and can be downloaded from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit
* Data source: https://zenodo.org/records/53894#.X9oeh3Uzaao by

  * Furberg, Robert
 
  * Brinton, Julia
 
  * Keating, Michael 
 
  * Ortiz, Alexa1


* Set up your MySQL connection within the R setup to run SQL Queries. Details can be found on the official Posit website https://solutions.posit.co/connections/db/
* Once you have run your analysis make sure you close the sql connection.

* NOTE: Code Chunks for setting up the sql connection and closing it have been removed from the RMD file uploaded here as these vary per user. You would need to add these seperately based on your configurations. Sufficient guidance is available on the posit website if you haven't done this before

* Datafiles used for this project have also been uploaded in the Fitbit_Data folder. The CSV filenames are pretty selfexplanatory, howevever an additional file has has been uploaded for identifying which file represents which indicator
